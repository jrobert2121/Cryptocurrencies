# Cryptocurrencies
This project entailed using unsupervised learning to group cryptocurrencies in order to create a classification system.  The input data required preprocessing that involved removing unnecessary data, using the get_dummies method to create variables, and then standardizing the features.  Next, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce dimensions down to 3 principal components.  Then in order to apply the KMeans algorithm, an elbow curve was created to determine the best K Value.  KMeans was initialized with 4 clusters based upon the results of the elbow curve to make predictions of the K clusters for the cryptocurrency data.  Finally, a 3D scatter was created to visualize the PCA data and the clusters, a table of tradable cryptocurriences was created, and then a scatter plot of total coins mined and the total coin supply was produced.
